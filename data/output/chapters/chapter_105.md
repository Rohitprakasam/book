Okay, I understand. I will remove the mathematical derivations and problems. I will focus on expanding the text with explanations, context, and relevant information without adding any formulas or equations not explicitly mentioned in the source.

=== REVISED EXPANSION PLAN ===
- **Section 1: Safety of Operation (Expanded)**-**Theoretical Introduction:**This section expands on the brief mention of safety by delving into the underlying principles of hazard identification, risk assessment, and safety mitigation specific to hydraulic and pneumatic systems. It will cover the high-energy nature of compressed fluids, the potential for catastrophic failures, and the importance of adherence to safety standards. The primary goal is preventing injury, death, and property damage through a comprehensive understanding of potential hazards. This includes a general overview of applicable OSHA standards and industry best practices from organizations like NFPA and ISO. The concept of potential energy stored in compressed fluids and its rapid conversion to kinetic energy upon release will be generally discussed. The importance of proper lockout/tagout procedures will be emphasized. Examples of potential hazards include high-pressure fluid injection injuries, uncontrolled movement of actuators, and noise exposure from pneumatic exhaust.
    -**Real-World Context:**Hydraulic and pneumatic systems are prevalent in a wide array of industrial applications, from heavy machinery and manufacturing equipment to aerospace and automotive systems. The inherent power and precision of these systems also present significant safety risks if not properly designed, maintained, and operated. For instance, in construction, hydraulic excavators and cranes rely on high-pressure hydraulic systems, and failures can lead to catastrophic accidents. Similarly, in manufacturing, automated machinery often incorporates pneumatic actuators that can cause injury if safety interlocks are bypassed or malfunction. In aerospace, the consequences of hydraulic system failure can be severe. Therefore, a strong emphasis on safety is paramount across all industries utilizing these technologies.
    -**Lockout/Tagout:**A crucial aspect of ensuring safety during maintenance and repair is the implementation of proper lockout/tagout procedures. These procedures involve isolating the hydraulic or pneumatic system from its energy source (e.g., pump, compressor), de-energizing the system, and physically locking and tagging the isolation points to prevent accidental re-energization. Lockout/tagout programs must be comprehensive and include documented procedures, employee training, and regular audits to ensure effectiveness. Specific lockout/tagout procedures vary depending on the complexity and configuration of the system but generally involve identifying all energy sources, isolating the system, dissipating stored energy, verifying isolation, and applying locks and tags.
    -**Safety Standards and Regulations:**Numerous safety standards and regulations govern the design, operation, and maintenance of hydraulic and pneumatic systems. These standards are developed and maintained by organizations such as OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), NFPA (National Fire Protection Association), and ISO (International Organization for Standardization). Adherence to these standards is essential for ensuring a safe working environment and preventing accidents. OSHA regulations, for example, specify requirements for machine guarding, lockout/tagout procedures, and employee training. NFPA standards provide guidance on the safe design and installation of hydraulic and pneumatic systems, while ISO standards offer internationally recognized best practices for safety management.
    -**Risk Assessment:**Performing a thorough risk assessment is critical for identifying potential hazards and implementing appropriate safety measures. Risk assessment involves systematically evaluating the likelihood and severity of potential accidents or incidents associated with the hydraulic or pneumatic system. This process typically includes hazard identification, risk analysis, and risk evaluation. Hazard identification involves identifying all potential sources of harm, such as high-pressure lines, moving parts, and electrical components. Risk analysis involves assessing the probability and severity of each identified hazard. Risk evaluation involves determining whether the level of risk is acceptable and, if not, implementing appropriate risk mitigation measures.
