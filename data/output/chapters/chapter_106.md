## 2. Performance of Desired Function

This chapter delves into the core principles governing the performance of hydraulic systems in achieving desired functionalities. We will explore the relationships between pressure, flow, force, torque, speed, and efficiency, and how these parameters interact within different hydraulic circuits.

### 2.1 Hydraulic Cylinder Force and Speed

Hydraulic cylinders are fundamental actuators in many industrial applications, converting hydraulic power into linear motion and force. Understanding the relationship between pressure, area, and force is crucial for designing and analyzing hydraulic systems. The concept of mechanical advantage is inherently linked to hydraulic cylinders: a small force applied over a small area (pump) can generate a much larger force over a larger area (cylinder). Flow rate plays a critical role in determining the speed at which the cylinder extends or retracts. However, the theoretical speed, calculated based on ideal conditions, often differs from the actual speed due to internal leakages and other inefficiencies within the system.

The force generated by a hydraulic cylinder is directly proportional to the pressure of the hydraulic fluid and the effective area on which the pressure acts. For a single-acting cylinder, the effective area is simply the cross-sectional area of the piston. However, for a double-acting cylinder, the effective area differs for extension and retraction strokes due to the presence of the piston rod.

The fundamental relationship can be derived from the definition of pressure as force per unit area. Pressure ($p$) is defined as:

$p = \frac{F}{A}$

Where:
- $F$ is the force applied.
- $A$ is the area over which the force is applied.

Solving for the Force ($F$), we obtain:
$F = pA$

For a double acting cylinder, the area is defined as:

$A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4}$ for extension

$A = \frac{\pi (D^2 - d^2)}{4}$ for retraction

where $D$ is the bore diameter and $d$ is the rod diameter.

The speed ($v$) of the cylinder is determined by the flow rate ($Q$) of the hydraulic fluid and the effective area ($A$) of the piston. The relationship is given by:

$v = \frac{Q}{A}$

Where:

- $v$ is the velocity of the piston (and thus the cylinder speed).
- $Q$ is the volumetric flow rate of the hydraulic fluid.
- $A$ is the effective area of the piston.

It's crucial to maintain consistent units when applying these equations. For example, if flow rate is in $m^3/s$ and area is in $m^2$, then velocity will be in $m/s$. It is equally valid to use $mm^3/s$ and $mm^2$ to obtain velocity in $mm/s$.

The actual speed of a hydraulic cylinder is often less than the theoretical speed due to internal leakages and other factors. This is captured by the concept of volumetric efficiency ($\eta_{vol}$), defined as:

$\eta_{vol} = \frac{Q_{actual}}{Q_{theoretical}}$

Where:

- $Q_{actual}$ is the actual flow rate into the cylinder.
- $Q_{theoretical}$ is the theoretical flow rate required to achieve a certain speed.

Therefore, the actual velocity is given by:

$v_{actual} = \eta_{vol} * \frac{Q_{theoretical}}{A}$

The hydraulic power ($\mathcal{P}$) delivered by the cylinder is the product of the force and velocity:

$\mathcal{P} = Fv = pAv = pQ$

**Mirror Problems:Problem 1 (Cylinder Force):**A hydraulic cylinder has a bore diameter ($D$) of 110 mm and operates at a pressure ($p$) of 12 MPa. Calculate the force ($F$) it can exert.

Step 1: Convert units to be consistent (mm to m, MPa to Pa).

$D = 110 \text{ mm} = 0.11 \text{ m}$
$p = 12 \text{ MPa} = 12 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}$

Step 2: Calculate the area ($A$).

$A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (0.11 \text{ m})^2}{4} \approx 0.0095 \text{ m}^2$

Step 3: Calculate the force ($F$).

$F = pA = (12 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa})(0.0095 \text{ m}^2) \approx 114000 \text{ N} = 114 \text{ kN}$**Problem 2 (Cylinder Speed):**A hydraulic cylinder with a bore diameter ($D$) of 70 mm and a rod diameter ($d$) of 35 mm is supplied with oil at a flow rate ($Q$) of 22 L/min. Calculate the extension and retraction speeds.

Step 1: Convert units to be consistent (mm to m, L/min to m³/s).

$D = 70 \text{ mm} = 0.07 \text{ m}$
$d = 35 \text{ mm} = 0.035 \text{ m}$
$Q = 22 \text{ L/min} = \frac{22}{1000 \times 60} \text{ m}^3/\text{s} \approx 0.000367 \text{ m}^3/\text{s}$

Step 2: Calculate the area for extension ($A_{ext}$).

$A_{ext} = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (0.07 \text{ m})^2}{4} \approx 0.00385 \text{ m}^2$

Step 3: Calculate the extension speed ($v_{ext}$).

$v_{ext} = \frac{Q}{A_{ext}} = \frac{0.000367 \text{ m}^3/\text{s}}{0.00385 \text{ m}^2} \approx 0.095 \text{ m/s}$

Step 4: Calculate the area for retraction ($A_{ret}$).

$A_{ret} = \frac{\pi (D^2 - d^2)}{4} = \frac{\pi ((0.07 \text{ m})^2 - (0.035 \text{ m})^2)}{4} \approx 0.00289 \text{ m}^2$

Step 5: Calculate the retraction speed ($v_{ret}$).

$v_{ret} = \frac{Q}{A_{ret}} = \frac{0.000367 \text{ m}^3/\text{s}}{0.00289 \text{ m}^2} \approx 0.127 \text{ m/s}$

The retraction speed is higher than the extension speed because the effective area is smaller during retraction.

### 2.2 Hydraulic Motor Torque and Speed

Hydraulic motors are the rotational counterparts of hydraulic cylinders. They convert hydraulic power into rotational mechanical power, characterized by torque and speed. Various types of hydraulic motors exist, including gear motors, vane motors, and piston motors, each with its own design and performance characteristics. The displacement of a hydraulic motor, defined as the volume of fluid required for one revolution, is a key parameter determining its speed and torque characteristics. Similar to hydraulic cylinders, the actual torque and speed of a hydraulic motor are affected by mechanical and volumetric efficiencies.

The theoretical torque ($T$) generated by a hydraulic motor is directly proportional to the motor's displacement ($V_d$) and the pressure ($p$) of the hydraulic fluid. This relationship can be derived from the principle of energy conservation. The energy input to the motor is the product of pressure and flow rate ($pQ$), while the energy output is the product of torque and angular velocity ($T\omega$). Equating these and considering the relationship between flow rate and displacement, we arrive at the following equation:

$T = \frac{V_d p}{2\pi}$

Where:

- $T$ is the theoretical torque.
- $V_d$ is the motor displacement (volume per revolution).
- $p$ is the pressure of the hydraulic fluid.

> 📊 *Diagram: {"subject": "Cutaway view of a piston motor (axial or radial), showing the pistons, cylinder block, and fluid flow path.", "type": "technical illustration"}*


The theoretical speed ($N$) of a hydraulic motor is determined by the flow rate ($Q$) of the hydraulic fluid and the motor's displacement ($V_d$). The equation is:

$N = \frac{Q}{V_d}$

Where:

- $N$ is the theoretical speed (typically in revolutions per minute or RPM).
- $Q$ is the flow rate of the hydraulic fluid.
- $V_d$ is the motor displacement (volume per revolution). Ensure units are consistent!

Mechanical efficiency ($\eta_{mech}$) accounts for the friction losses within the motor and is defined as:

$\eta_{mech} = \frac{T_{actual}}{T_{theoretical}}$

Volumetric efficiency ($\eta_{vol}$) accounts for internal leakage within the motor and is defined as:

$\eta_{vol} = \frac{N_{actual}}{N_{theoretical}} = \frac{Q_{theoretical}}{Q_{actual}}$

Therefore, the actual torque and speed are lower than the theoretical values:

$T_{actual} = \eta_{mech}T_{theoretical}$

$N_{actual} = \eta_{vol}N_{theoretical}$

The hydraulic power ($\mathcal{P}$) delivered to the motor is given by:

$\mathcal{P} = T\omega = Qp$

Where $\omega$ is the angular velocity in rad/s, and $\omega = 2\pi N/60$ (if N is in RPM).**Mirror Problems:Problem 1 (Motor Torque):**A hydraulic motor has a displacement ($V_d$) of 120 $cm^3$/rev and operates at a pressure ($p$) of 20 MPa. Calculate the theoretical torque ($T$).

Step 1: Convert units to be consistent ($cm^3$ to $m^3$, MPa to Pa).

$V_d = 120 \text{ cm}^3/\text{rev} = 120 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3/\text{rev}$
$p = 20 \text{ MPa} = 20 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}$

Step 2: Calculate the theoretical torque ($T$).

$T = \frac{V_d p}{2\pi} = \frac{(120 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3/\text{rev})(20 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa})}{2\pi} \approx 382 \text{ Nm}$**Problem 2 (Motor Speed):**A hydraulic motor with a displacement ($V_d$) of 100 $cm^3$/rev is supplied with oil at a flow rate ($Q$) of 35 L/min. Calculate the theoretical speed ($N$).

Step 1: Convert units to be consistent ($cm^3$ to $m^3$, L/min to $m^3$/s).

$V_d = 100 \text{ cm}^3/\text{rev} = 100 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3/\text{rev}$
$Q = 35 \text{ L/min} = \frac{35}{1000 \times 60} \text{ m}^3/\text{s} \approx 0.000583 \text{ m}^3/\text{s}$

Step 2: Calculate the theoretical speed ($N$) in rev/s.

$N = \frac{Q}{V_d} = \frac{0.000583 \text{ m}^3/\text{s}}{100 \times 10^{-6} \text{ m}^3/\text{rev}} \approx 5.83 \text{ rev/s}$

Step 3: Convert the speed to RPM.

$N = 5.83 \text{ rev/s} \times 60 \text{ s/min} \approx 350 \text{ RPM}$

### 2.3 Hydraulic Circuits for Specific Functions: Lifting, Pressing, and Rotating

Hydraulic circuits are carefully designed combinations of hydraulic components such as pumps, valves, cylinders/motors, and reservoirs, interconnected to perform specific functions. Common functions include lifting loads (cranes, elevators), applying pressure (hydraulic presses), and generating rotary motion (conveyors, winches).

Different types of valves play critical roles in these circuits. Directional control valves (DCVs) control the direction of fluid flow, enabling the cylinder or motor to move in the desired direction. Pressure control valves, such as relief valves and pressure reducing valves, regulate the system pressure to prevent overloads and maintain desired operating conditions. Flow control valves regulate the flow rate, controlling the speed of the actuator.

Safety is paramount in hydraulic system design. Pressure relief valves are essential for preventing over-pressurization, and emergency shut-off mechanisms should be included to quickly stop the system in case of a malfunction. Regular inspection and maintenance are crucial to prevent leaks and ensure safe operation.

Analyzing these circuits involves applying the fundamental principles of force, pressure, and flow. For example, in a lifting circuit, the pump must provide sufficient flow to raise the load at the desired speed, and the pump pressure must be high enough to overcome the load force. Similarly, for a rotating circuit, the pump flow rate determines the motor speed, and the pump pressure determines the motor torque. Pressure losses across valves and fittings must also be considered when analyzing circuit performance. A simplified model for valve pressure drop may be:

$\Delta p_{valve} = kQ^2$

Where:
- $\Delta p_{valve}$ is the pressure drop across the valve.
- $k$ is a constant dependent on valve geometry and fluid properties.
- $Q$ is the flow rate through the valve.

**Mirror Problems:Problem 1 (Lifting Circuit):**

A hydraulic circuit for lifting a load ($F_{load}$) of 50 kN uses a cylinder with a bore ($D$) of 100 mm. The pump supplies oil at a flow rate ($Q$) of 25 L/min. Calculate the lifting speed ($v$) and the required pump pressure ($p$), assuming a valve pressure drop ($\Delta p_{valve}$) of 2 MPa.

Step 1: Convert units.

$F_{load} = 50 \text{ kN} = 50000 \text{ N}$
$D = 100 \text{ mm} = 0.1 \text{ m}$
$Q = 25 \text{ L/min} = \frac{25}{1000 \times 60} \text{ m}^3/\text{s} \approx 0.000417 \text{ m}^3/\text{s}$
$\Delta p_{valve} = 2 \text{ MPa} = 2 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}$

Step 2: Calculate the cylinder area ($A$).

$A = \frac{\pi D^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (0.1 \text{ m})^2}{4} \approx 0.00785 \text{ m}^2$

Step 3: Calculate the lifting speed ($v$).

$v = \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{0.000417 \text{ m}^3/\text{s}}{0.00785 \text{ m}^2} \approx 0.053 \text{ m/s}$

Step 4: Calculate the pressure required to lift the load ($p_{cylinder}$).

$p_{cylinder} = \frac{F_{load}}{A} = \frac{50000 \text{ N}}{0.00785 \text{ m}^2} \approx 6.37 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa} = 6.37 \text{ MPa}$

Step 5: Calculate the required pump pressure ($p$). This must overcome the cylinder pressure *and* the valve pressure drop.

$p = p_{cylinder} + \Delta p_{valve} = 6.37 \text{ MPa} + 2 \text{ MPa} = 8.37 \text{ MPa}$
