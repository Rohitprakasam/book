In this configuration, the proportional solenoid exerts a force on the poppet, maintaining the valve in a closed state. This remains until the hydraulic pressure at port P surpasses the solenoid's force, causing the valve to open. This type of valve offers a continuously variable control of pressure, unlike simple on/off valves.

The force exerted by the proportional solenoid is inherently limited by its physical size. To accommodate higher operating pressures, the orifice size within the valve is reduced, and conversely, the orifice size is increased for lower operating pressures. The resulting operating pressures of the valve are directly influenced by both the current supplied to the solenoid and the volumetric flow rate of fluid passing through the valve. The valve's performance characteristics are therefore intricately linked to these electrical and hydraulic parameters.

### Proportional Pressure Reducing Valve

This valve operates on a principle akin to that of a conventional pressure regulating valve. However, the key distinction lies in the replacement of the traditional control spring with a proportional solenoid. This substitution facilitates electrical control over the desired output pressure. Notably, when the solenoid is de-energized, the proportional valve remains closed, contrasting with the behavior of a conventional pressure reducing valve, which is typically open in its unactuated state. The advent of proportional valves has allowed for finer control of hydraulic systems, enabling smoother operation and remote adjustability, which were previously unattainable with discrete on/off control systems. However, proportional valves do have their limitations. Hysteresis and non-linearity in the solenoid's force-current relationship can affect the accuracy of pressure regulation.

The traditional pressure reducing valve works by balancing the force of an adjustable spring against the force exerted by the outlet pressure on a spool. Consider a simple pressure reducing valve where the spring force $F_{spring}$ acts on a spool of area $A_{spool}$, and the outlet pressure $p_{out}$ acts on the same area. The valve regulates pressure by modulating the flow through an orifice. The force balance equation is:

$F_{spring} = p_{out} \times A_{spool}$

The spring force is related to the spring constant $k$ and the spring compression $x$ by:

$F_{spring} = k \times x$

Therefore, $k \times x = p_{out} \times A_{spool}$, and $p_{out} = (k \times x) / A_{spool}$. The outlet pressure is directly proportional to the spring compression.

In a proportional pressure reducing valve, the spring is replaced by a proportional solenoid. The magnetic force $F_{mag}$ generated by the solenoid is proportional to the current $i$ flowing through it. The relationship can be expressed as:

$F_{mag} = K_{sol} \times i$

where $K_{sol}$ is the solenoid constant, representing the force generated per unit of current.

The force balance equation for the proportional pressure reducing valve becomes:

$F_{mag} = p_{out} \times A_{spool}$

Substituting the expression for $F_{mag}$, we get:

$K_{sol} \times i = p_{out} \times A_{spool}$

Therefore, the outlet pressure is a function of the solenoid current:

$p_{out} = (K_{sol} \times i) / A_{spool}$

*Example Problem 1: Solenoid Force Calculation*

A proportional solenoid has a solenoid constant of $K_{sol} = 0.3 \, \text{N/mA}$. If the current flowing through the solenoid is $i = 250 \, \text{mA}$, what is the magnetic force generated by the solenoid?

Solution:
Using the formula $F_{mag} = K_{sol} \times i$, we have:

$F_{mag} = 0.3 \, \text{N/mA} \times 250 \, \text{mA} = 75 \, \text{N}$

The magnetic force generated is $75 \, \text{N}$.

*Example Problem 2: Output Pressure Calculation*

A proportional pressure reducing valve has a spool area of $A_{spool} = 15 \, \text{mm}^2$ and a solenoid constant of $K_{sol} = 0.2 \, \text{N/mA}$. If the current flowing through the solenoid is $i = 300 \, \text{mA}$, what is the output pressure of the valve?

Solution:
First, convert the spool area to square meters: $A_{spool} = 15 \, \text{mm}^2 = 15 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2$.

Using the formula $p_{out} = (K_{sol} \times i) / A_{spool}$, we have:

$p_{out} = (0.2 \, \text{N/mA} \times 300 \, \text{mA}) / (15 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2) = 60 \, \text{N} / (15 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2) = 4 \times 10^6 \, \text{N/m}^2 = 4 \, \text{MPa}$

The output pressure of the valve is $4 \, \text{MPa}$.

A signal originating from the servo amplifier causes a displacement of the pilot spool to the right. This allows the control pressure acting on area M to move the main spool to the left. This occurs because area N is now connected to the drain. Consequently, the main supply pressure is directed into port B. The hydraulic cylinder will then not move in the opposite direction. Critically, the extent of movement is directly proportional to the electrical command signal. This illustrates a direct link between the electrical input and the resulting mechanical output.

The valve incorporates a feedback linkage that mechanically connects the main spool and the pilot spool sleeve. Any movement of the main spool is thus transmitted back through this linkage to influence the pilot spool sleeve. The sleeve effectively "follows" the pilot spool, adjusting to the new position until the control pressure is cut off. This feedback mechanism is what allows the servo valve to achieve extremely accurate flow modulation, facilitating fast and precise control of position, velocity, and acceleration of an actuator. This level of control is essential in applications requiring high precision, such as robotics, aerospace, and advanced manufacturing.

### Flapper Type Servo Valve

In this type of valve, the sliding spool is actuated by a pressure difference created at its two ends. Under normal conditions, the control pressure is equal at both ends of the spool, maintaining a balanced state. A controlled amount of fluid continuously flows through the orifice passages of the nozzles, impinging against a component known as the 'flapper.'

The spool's movement is directly proportional to the movement of the flapper valve, which, in turn, is proportional to the input current. This cascading proportionality ensures that the volume of fluid passing through the valve is also proportional to the input current. The flapper-nozzle valve is a classical example of a high-gain amplifier, where a small displacement of the flapper results in a large change in the output pressure.

Electro-hydraulic servo systems employing this design necessitate fluids that are continuously filtered to maintain a high degree of cleanliness, typically down to a level of 10 microns absolute. This stringent requirement stems from the small orifices and close tolerances within the valve, which are highly susceptible to clogging and malfunction if contaminated fluids are used. The cost of maintaining this level of cleanliness is one of the trade-offs associated with flapper-nozzle servo valves.

The flapper-nozzle valve can be understood through the Wheatstone bridge analogy, where each nozzle acts as a resistor and the flapper's displacement changes the flow through the nozzles, creating a pressure differential.

Let the supply pressure be $p_s$. The pressure at each end of the spool depends on the flow resistance of the nozzles. When the flapper is centered, the pressure at both ends is $p_s/2$. A displacement $\delta$ of the flapper changes the flow through the nozzles and therefore the pressure. The pressure difference across the spool is $\Delta p$. The spool position $x$ is proportional to the pressure difference: $x = K \Delta p$. The flow through the nozzles is affected by the flapper position. The pressure difference created by the flapper movement can be approximated as:

$\Delta p = K_{flapper} \times \delta$

where $K_{flapper}$ is a constant that depends on the nozzle geometry and supply pressure.

*Example Problem 1: Pressure Difference Calculation*

A flapper-nozzle valve has a supply pressure of $p_s = 20 \, \text{MPa}$. The flapper displacement is $\delta = 0.01 \, \text{mm}$. The valve constant $K_{flapper} = 5 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa/m}$. Calculate the pressure difference across the spool.

Solution:
$\Delta p = K_{flapper} \times \delta = (5 \times 10^8 \, \text{Pa/m}) \times (0.01 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{m}) = 5 \times 10^3 \, \text{Pa} = 5 \, \text{kPa}$

*Example Problem 2: Spool Position Calculation*

A spool has an area of $A_{s} = 20 \, \text{mm}^2$, viscous friction coefficient is $\mu=10 \, \text{Ns/m}$. Using the result of the last problem, find the spool position.

Solution:
Using the Newton's second law, and assuming steady-state flow (no acceleration), the forces acting on the spool must balance:
$\Delta p \cdot A_s = \mu \cdot v = \mu \cdot \frac{dx}{dt}$. Since we assume steady state, $x$ is constant in time. However, this is a quasi-static assumption where the flapper continuously deflects over a period of time. Let's instead look at a dynamic problem.

$m \ddot{x} + \mu \dot{x} + kx = \Delta p A_s$

Here $m$ is the mass of the spool, $x$ is the displacement, and $k$ is the spring constant which is negligible for servo valves. Then:

$x = \Delta p \cdot A_s / k$.

However, without the spring this becomes problematic as it would result in infinite displacement. Instead we'll determine what velocity we reach when applying the flapper displacement:

$v = \frac{\Delta p \cdot A_s}{\mu} = \frac{5 kPa \cdot 20 mm^2}{10 Ns/m} = \frac{5 \cdot 10^3 Pa \cdot 20 \cdot 10^{-6} m^2}{10 Ns/m} = 0.01 m/s$.

### Proportional Valves

Conventional solenoid-operated directional control valves function as digital control systems, operating in a binary fashion: either fully open or, when the solenoid is energized, fully closed. This on/off behavior limits their applicability in scenarios requiring more nuanced control.

Proportional valves, on the other hand, offer a continuous range of control between fully open and fully closed. This is achieved by modulating the position of the valve spool in proportion to an electrical input signal. Different types of proportional valves exist, including directional control, pressure control, and flow control valves, each designed to regulate specific parameters within a hydraulic system. The advantages of proportional control over on/off control include smoother operation, more precise control of speed and force, and the ability to implement more sophisticated control strategies.

Proportional valves find widespread use in various applications, including mobile hydraulics (e.g., in construction equipment), industrial automation (e.g., in machine tools), and aerospace (e.g., in flight control systems). They can be used in either open-loop or closed-loop control systems. In open-loop control, the valve position is directly controlled by the input signal, without any feedback from the output. In closed-loop control, a sensor measures the output parameter (e.g., position, pressure, or flow) and provides feedback to the controller, which adjusts the valve position to maintain the desired setpoint. While servo valves offer superior performance in terms of bandwidth and accuracy, proportional valves provide a cost-effective alternative for applications where less demanding performance requirements are acceptable.

For a proportional directional control valve, the flow rate $Q$ through the valve can be modeled as a function of the spool position $x$ and the pressure drop $\Delta p$ across the valve. A simplified model can be expressed as:

$Q = C_d \cdot A(x) \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta p}{\rho}}$

where $C_d$ is the discharge coefficient, $A(x)$ is the effective flow area as a function of spool position, and $\rho$ is the fluid density. The effective flow area depends on the valve geometry and the spool position.

The relationship between the input signal $V_{in}$ (e.g., voltage) and the spool position $x$ can be approximated as:

$x = K_v \cdot V_{in}$

where $K_v$ is the valve gain, representing the spool displacement per unit of input voltage.

*Example Problem 1: Flow Rate Calculation*

A proportional directional control valve has a discharge coefficient of $C_d = 0.7$, a spool position of $x = 2 \, \text{mm}$, which results in a flow area of $A(x) = 10 \, \text{mm}^2$, and a pressure drop of $\Delta p = 5 \, \text{MPa}$. The fluid density is $\rho = 850 \, \text{kg/m}^3$. Calculate the flow rate through the valve.

Solution:
First, convert the flow area to square meters: $A(x) = 10 \, \text{mm}^2 = 10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2$. Also convert the pressure drop to Pascals: $\Delta p = 5 \, \text{MPa} = 5 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa}$.

Using the formula $Q = C_d \cdot A(x) \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2 \Delta p}{\rho}}$, we have:

$Q = 0.7 \cdot (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2) \cdot \sqrt{\frac{2 \cdot 5 \times 10^6 \, \text{Pa}}{850 \, \text{kg/m}^3}} = 0.7 \cdot (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2) \cdot \sqrt{11764.7 \, \text{m}^2/\text{s}^2} = 0.7 \cdot (10 \times 10^{-6} \, \text{m}^2) \cdot 108.47 \, \text{m/s} = 7.59 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{m}^3/\text{s} = 0.759 \, \text{L/s}$

The flow rate through the valve is $0.759 \, \text{L/s}$.

*Example Problem 2: Spool Position Calculation*

A proportional directional control valve has a valve gain of $K_v = 0.5 \, \text{mm/V}$. If the input voltage is $V_{in} = 4 \, \text{V}$, what is the spool position?

Solution:
Using the formula $x = K_v \cdot V_{in}$, we have:

$x = 0.5 \, \text{mm/V} \cdot 4 \, \text{V} = 2 \, \text{mm}$

The spool position is $2 \, \text{mm}$.
