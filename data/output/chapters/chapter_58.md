## Hydrodynamic or Non-Positive Displacement Pumps

1.  **Introduction to Hydrodynamic (Non-Positive Displacement) Pumps**

    Hydrodynamic pumps, also known as non-positive displacement pumps, represent a class of pumps where fluid flow is generated primarily through momentum transfer rather than by trapping a fixed volume of fluid. This contrasts directly with positive displacement pumps, which physically capture a defined volume of fluid and force it through the system with each cycle. Examples of positive displacement pumps include gear pumps, piston pumps, and vane pumps. The key difference lies in the internal sealing mechanism. Positive displacement pumps feature a near-perfect seal between the inlet and outlet, ensuring that each rotation or cycle delivers a consistent volume of fluid, largely independent of the system pressure.

    In non-positive displacement pumps, such as centrifugal and axial (propeller) pumps, the fluid is accelerated by an impeller or propeller. The kinetic energy imparted to the fluid is then converted into pressure energy. However, there isn't a "positive" seal preventing fluid from slipping back from the high-pressure outlet to the low-pressure inlet. This "slippage" is a crucial characteristic that dictates their performance. These pumps are well-suited for applications requiring high volume flow at relatively low pressures, such as water distribution systems, irrigation, and cooling systems. The principle behind these pumps relies on fundamental concepts like conservation of mass, where the mass flow rate remains constant throughout the system, and momentum transfer, where the rotating impeller transfers momentum to the fluid, increasing its velocity and pressure. The pressure is generated due to the centrifugal force acting on the fluid as it rotates with the impeller.

    Historically, the development of hydrodynamic pumps, particularly centrifugal pumps, was pivotal in enabling large-scale water supply systems for cities and industries. Early designs, dating back to the 17th century, were inefficient but laid the groundwork for the modern pumps we use today. Significant advancements in impeller design, volute geometry, and materials have dramatically improved the performance and reliability of these pumps. The adoption of centrifugal pumps in industries like power generation, chemical processing, and oil and gas has further driven innovation and optimization.

    Due to the inherent clearances between the rotating and stationary components in these pumps, a phenomenon called "slip" occurs. As the resistance in the external system increases (for instance, due to a partially closed valve), the pressure at the outlet rises. This increased pressure forces some of the fluid to leak or "slip" back through the internal clearances from the outlet side to the inlet side. This slippage directly reduces the actual flow rate delivered by the pump compared to the theoretical flow rate it *should* deliver based on its rotational speed. Consequently, the *volumetric efficiency* of the pump decreases with increasing system pressure. The amount of slippage depends on factors such as the clearance size, fluid viscosity, and pressure differential. Understanding and minimizing slippage is crucial for optimizing pump performance.

    Another critical characteristic of most hydrodynamic pumps is that they are not self-priming. Priming refers to the process of filling the pump casing and suction line with the fluid to be pumped before starting the pump. This is necessary because hydrodynamic pumps rely on the fluid's inertia and momentum to create a pressure differential. If the pump casing is filled with air, the impeller will simply rotate in the air, failing to generate sufficient suction to draw fluid into the pump. The large internal clearances prevent the pump from creating a strong enough vacuum to draw fluid from a lower level against atmospheric pressure. Positive displacement pumps, with their tight seals, are often self-priming to a degree. The lack of self-priming capability in hydrodynamic pumps necessitates auxiliary priming systems or manual filling before initial operation. In industrial settings, various priming methods are employed, including ejector pumps, vacuum pumps, and foot valves, to ensure reliable pump startup.

2.  **Mathematical Derivations**

    Let's derive a simplified equation for the pressure head generated by a centrifugal pump, starting from Euler's pump equation. Euler's equation provides a theoretical basis for understanding the energy transfer in a rotating impeller. This equation is derived from the principles of angular momentum and energy conservation within a rotating fluid system.

    Euler's Pump Equation:

    $E = \frac{v_B^2 - v_A^2}{2g} + \frac{V_{bB}v_B - V_{bA}v_A}{g}$

    Where:

    - $E$ is the energy transferred to the fluid per unit weight (theoretical head).
    - $v_B$ and $v_A$ are the impeller tip speeds at the outlet and inlet, respectively.
    - $V_{bB}$ and $V_{bA}$ are the whirl (tangential) velocity components of the fluid at the outlet and inlet, respectively.
    - $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.

    We can simplify this equation under certain assumptions: incompressible fluid and uniform flow distribution. Let $v = \omega r$, where $\omega$ is the angular velocity (rad/s) and $r$ is the radius. Assuming the inlet whirl velocity ($V_{bA}$) is zero (i.e., the fluid enters the impeller radially), the equation simplifies to: This assumption is common in many centrifugal pump designs to minimize energy losses at the inlet.

    $E = \frac{(\omega r_B)^2 - (\omega r_A)^2}{2g} + \frac{V_{bB}\omega r_B}{g}$

    Further simplification depends on knowing the outlet whirl velocity, but this simplified form illustrates the head is proportional to the square of the rotational speed and the impeller radius. In real-world applications, the Euler head needs to be corrected with hydraulic and volumetric efficiency factors. These efficiency factors account for energy losses due to friction, turbulence, and slippage within the pump.

    {
      "subject": "Velocity triangles at the inlet and outlet of a centrifugal pump impeller blade",
      "type": "technical illustration",
      "details": "Show $u_1, u_2, V_1, V_2, V_{w1}, V_{w2}$ on the diagram, clearly labeling each vector. Indicate the blade angles at the inlet and outlet."
    }

    Next, let's define the volumetric efficiency ($\eta_v$). It's the ratio of the actual flow rate ($Q_a$) delivered by the pump to the theoretical flow rate ($Q_t$) it *should* deliver based on its geometry and speed. Volumetric efficiency is a critical parameter in evaluating the overall performance of a pump.

    $\eta_v = \frac{Q_a}{Q_t}$

    The theoretical flow rate can be expressed as $Q_t = N * V_d$, where $N$ is the rotational speed and $V_d$ is the theoretical displacement per revolution. In the case of non-positive displacement pumps, $V_d$ isn't a fixed physical displacement but rather a calculated value based on impeller geometry and speed, representing the ideal flow if there were no slip. This theoretical displacement is often determined through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations or empirical testing.

    Therefore:

    $\eta_v = \frac{Q_a}{N*V_d}$

    A volumetric efficiency of 100% would mean no slippage, which is never the case in hydrodynamic pumps. In practice, volumetric efficiencies for centrifugal pumps typically range from 60% to 90%, depending on the pump design, operating conditions, and fluid properties. Factors such as impeller wear, increased fluid viscosity, and high operating pressures can reduce volumetric efficiency.

3.  **Mirror ProblemsProblem 1 (Centrifugal Pump Head):** A centrifugal pump has an impeller diameter of 250mm (0.25m) and rotates at 1800 RPM. The inlet blade angle is designed for radial entry ($V_{bA} = 0$). The outlet whirl velocity is estimated to be 80% of the impeller tip speed at the outlet ($V_{bB} = 0.8 * \omega r_B$). Calculate the theoretical head developed by the pump.

    *Solution:*

    1.  Calculate angular velocity: $\omega = \frac{2\pi N}{60} = \frac{2\pi * 1800}{60} = 188.5 \text{ rad/s}$
    2.  Calculate impeller tip speed at the outlet: $v_B = \omega r_B = 188.5 * (0.25/2) = 23.56 \text{ m/s}$
    3.  Calculate the outlet whirl velocity: $V_{bB} = 0.8 * v_B = 0.8 * 23.56 = 18.85 \text{ m/s}$
    4.  Apply the simplified Euler's equation: $E = \frac{(\omega r_B)^2 - (\omega r_A)^2}{2g} + \frac{V_{bB}\omega r_B}{g} = \frac{(23.56)^2 - 0}{2*9.81} + \frac{18.85*23.56}{9.81} = 28.28 + 45.24 = 73.52 \text{ m}$

    **Problem 2 (Volumetric Efficiency):** A centrifugal pump with a theoretical flow rate of 200 LPM, calculated from its geometry and speed, delivers an actual flow rate of 170 LPM at a specific pressure. Calculate the volumetric efficiency.

    *Solution:*

    1.  Apply the volumetric efficiency formula: $\eta_v = \frac{Q_a}{Q_t} = \frac{170}{200} = 0.85$
    2.  Express as a percentage: $\eta_v = 0.85 * 100\% = 85\%$

    **Problem 3 (Effect of Slip):** A centrifugal pump delivers 160 LPM at 0.3 MPa. If the slip is estimated at 25 LPM under these conditions, calculate the theoretical flow rate and volumetric efficiency.

    *Solution:*

    1.  Calculate the theoretical flow rate: $Q_t = Q_a + Q_{slip} = 160 + 25 = 185 \text{ LPM}$
    2.  Apply the volumetric efficiency formula: $\eta_v = \frac{Q_a}{Q_t} = \frac{160}{185} = 0.865$
    3.  Express as a percentage: $\eta_v = 0.865 * 100\% = 86.5\%$

    **Problem 4 (Pump Selection):** A system requires a flow rate of 140 LPM at a head of 25 meters. Based on the pump performance curve below, select a suitable centrifugal pump.

       "description": "Centrifugal pump performance curve showing shutoff head and operating point."
    }
    

    *Solution:*

    Locate the point on the pump performance curve corresponding to 140 LPM and 25 meters. If this point falls on or near the pump's characteristic curve, the pump is suitable for the application. If the point is far from the curve, a different pump with a more appropriate performance curve should be selected. This problem is best answered with the aid of a visual pump curve and would require access to pump manufacturer's catalogs or databases. Important parameters from the curve to note are the Best Efficiency Point (BEP) and the acceptable operating range around it. Operating too far from BEP will result in energy waste and potentially pump damage.

    }

4.  **Centrifugal Pump Operation and Characteristics**

    The operating principle of a centrifugal pump hinges on the conversion of kinetic energy into pressure energy. The impeller, driven by a motor, rotates at high speed, imparting kinetic energy to the fluid as it passes through the impeller vanes. As the fluid exits the impeller, it enters the volute (a spiral-shaped casing) or diffuser vanes. These components are designed to gradually reduce the fluid's velocity, converting the kinetic energy into pressure energy. This pressure increase is what drives the fluid through the downstream piping system. The design of the volute and diffuser vanes is critical to achieving efficient energy conversion and minimizing losses.

    A key characteristic of centrifugal pumps is the "shutoff head." This refers to the maximum pressure the pump can develop when the discharge valve is completely closed, resulting in zero flow. At this point, the impeller is still rotating, but all the energy it imparts to the fluid is converted into pressure. Unlike positive displacement pumps, a centrifugal pump can operate indefinitely against a closed valve *without* causing damage to the pump itself or the system. This is because the slippage within the pump allows the fluid to recirculate within the casing, preventing excessive pressure buildup. However, prolonged operation at shutoff head can lead to overheating of the fluid within the pump casing due to the continuous energy input from the impeller. This is a significant advantage over positive displacement pumps, which would require a relief valve to prevent catastrophic failure under blocked flow conditions. In industrial applications, temperature sensors and alarms are often installed to monitor pump temperature and prevent overheating during prolonged shutoff head operation.

    Another important operational consideration is "runout," which occurs when the pump operates far to the right on its performance curve. This typically happens when the system resistance is very low, leading to very high flow rates. While this might seem desirable, it can have detrimental effects. First, the pump's efficiency drops significantly at high flow rates, leading to increased energy consumption. Second, the increased flow velocity can cause cavitation, where vapor bubbles form and collapse within the impeller, leading to erosion and damage. Third, the motor driving the pump can become overloaded due to the increased power demand at high flow rates, potentially leading to motor failure. Thus, it is critical to match the pump's operating point to the system requirements to maintain efficiency, prevent damage, and ensure reliable operation. Pump selection software and system design tools can assist in determining the optimal pump size and operating conditions.

5.  **Mathematical Derivations**Pump affinity laws describe the relationships between a centrifugal pump's flow rate, head, and power with respect to changes in pump speed and impeller diameter. They are extremely useful for predicting pump performance under different operating conditions. These laws are derived based on the assumption of homologous conditions, meaning that the flow patterns within the pump remain similar even when the speed or impeller diameter changes.

    -**Flow Rate:**$ \frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \frac{N_1}{N_2} (\frac{D_1}{D_2})^3 $

        Where:

        - $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ are the flow rates at conditions 1 and 2.
        - $N_1$ and $N_2$ are the rotational speeds at conditions 1 and 2.
        - $D_1$ and $D_2$ are the impeller diameters at conditions 1 and 2.

        If the impeller diameter remains constant ($D_1 = D_2$), the equation simplifies to:

        $ \frac{Q_1}{Q_2} = \frac{N_1}{N_2} $ (Flow is directly proportional to speed)

    -**Head:**$ \frac{H_1}{H_2} = (\frac{N_1}{N_2})^2 (\frac{D_1}{D_2})^2 $

        Where:

        - $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the heads at conditions 1 and 2.

        If the impeller diameter remains constant ($D_1 = D_2$), the equation simplifies to:

        $ \frac{H_1}{H_2} = (\frac{N_1}{N_2})^2 $ (Head is proportional to the square of the speed)

    -**Power:**$ \frac{\mathcal{P}_1}{\mathcal{P}_2} = (\frac{N_1}{N_2})^3 (\frac{D_1}{D_2})^5 $

        Where:

        - $\mathcal{P}_1$ and $\mathcal{P}_2$ are the powers at conditions 1 and 2.

        If the impeller diameter remains constant ($D_1 = D_2$), the equation simplifies to:

        $ \frac{\mathcal{P}_1}{\mathcal{P}_2} = (\frac{N_1}{N_2})^3 $ (Power is proportional to the cube of the speed)

    The specific speed ($N_s$) is a dimensionless parameter (although often expressed with dimensioned units) used to categorize pumps and select the most appropriate pump type for a given application. It relates the pump's flow rate, head, and rotational speed at its point of maximum efficiency. The specific speed is an important indicator of the pump's hydraulic design and performance characteristics.

    $\displaystyle N_s = \frac{N \sqrt{Q}}{H^{3/4}} $

    Where:

    - $N$ is the rotational speed (RPM)
    - $Q$ is the flow rate (GPM - US gallons per minute)
    - $H$ is the head (feet)

    Note the specific units used for Q and H in this equation. To get a dimensionless value, the appropriate conversion factors must be applied. The specific speed helps classify pumps as radial flow, mixed flow, or axial flow. Radial flow pumps typically have low specific speeds (500-2000), mixed flow pumps have medium specific speeds (2000-5000), and axial flow pumps have high specific speeds (5000-15000). The optimal pump type for a specific application can be selected based on the required flow rate and head. Consulting pump selection charts and software tools is crucial for accurate pump selection based on specific speed and other performance parameters.

6.**Mirror ProblemsProblem 1 (Affinity Laws - Speed Change):** A centrifugal pump delivers 130 LPM at a head of 22 m when running at 1600 RPM. What will the flow rate and head be if the speed is increased to 1900 RPM?

    *Solution:*

    1.  Calculate the new flow rate: $Q_2 = Q_1 * \frac{N_2}{N_1} = 130 * \frac{1900}{1600} = 154.38 \text{ LPM}$
    2.  Calculate the new head: $H_2 = H_1 * (\frac{N_2}{N_1})^2 = 22 * (\frac{1900}{1600})^2 = 31.02 \text{ m}$

    **Problem 2 (Affinity Laws - Diameter Change):** A pump with a 210mm impeller delivers 110 LPM. What flow rate can be expected if the impeller is trimmed to 190mm, assuming constant speed?

    *Solution:*

    1.  Calculate the new flow rate: $Q_2 = Q_1 * (\frac{D_2}{D_1})^3 = 110 * (\frac{190}{210})^3 = 85.46 \text{ LPM}$

    **Problem 3 (Specific Speed):** A pump delivers 160 LPM (42.3 GPM) at a head of 27 m (88.6 ft) when running at 1800 RPM. Calculate the specific speed of the pump.

    *Solution:*

    1.  Apply the specific speed formula: $\displaystyle N_s = \frac{N \sqrt{Q}}{H^{3/4}} = \frac{1800 * \sqrt{42.3}}{88.6^{3/4}} = \frac{1800 * 6.50}{30.57} = 382.7$ (using units of RPM, GPM, and feet)

    **Problem 4 (Pump Selection using Specific Speed):** A system requires 140 LPM (37 GPM) at 24 m (78.7 ft) head. Choose a suitable pump type (radial, mixed flow, axial) based on specific speed considerations. Explain your choice.

    *Solution:*

    1.  Calculate the specific speed: $\displaystyle N_s = \frac{N \sqrt{Q}}{H^{3/4}} = \frac{N * \sqrt{37}}{78.7^{3/4}} = \frac{N*6.08}{26.46} = 0.23 * N$

    Without knowing the rotational speed (N), we cannot determine the exact specific speed. However, we can analyze the *effect* of different rotational speeds.

    - If N = 1750 RPM, then Ns = 402.5
    - If N = 3500 RPM, then Ns = 805

    Since the specific speed will likely be under 2000, a radial flow pump would be the most suitable choice for this application. Radial flow pumps are generally best suited for low specific speed applications, meaning relatively low flow and relatively high head.

7.  **Axial Flow (Propeller) Pumps**Axial flow pumps, also known as propeller pumps, operate on a different principle than centrifugal pumps. In these pumps, the fluid flows primarily in an axial direction, parallel to the pump's axis of rotation. The key component is a propeller, similar in design to an airplane propeller or a boat propeller, which rotates within a cylindrical casing. As the propeller spins, its blades generate lift, similar to how an airplane wing generates lift. This lift force pushes the fluid axially through the pump. Stator vanes are often positioned downstream of the propeller to straighten the swirling flow and improve the pump's efficiency. The number and shape of the propeller blades, as well as the design of the stator vanes, influence the pump's performance characteristics.

    Compared to centrifugal pumps, axial flow pumps excel in applications requiring very high flow rates at relatively low heads (low pressure). Centrifugal pumps are better suited for moderate flow rates and moderate to high heads. While a centrifugal pump increases the pressure of the fluid radially, an axial flow pump imparts momentum axially. A key difference is the geometry of the impeller/propeller and the flow path. Axial flow pumps are less sensitive to changes in viscosity than centrifugal pumps, making them suitable for certain applications involving viscous fluids.

    Historically, axial flow pumps have been used extensively in land drainage and irrigation systems. Their ability to move large volumes of water efficiently makes them ideal for these applications. The development of efficient axial flow pumps has played a significant role in enabling large-scale agricultural practices and flood control measures.

    Axial flow pumps are particularly well-suited for applications like flood control, irrigation, and wastewater treatment, where large volumes of fluid need to be moved efficiently over short distances. Due to their design, they are highly efficient at delivering high flow rates with minimal head loss. In wastewater treatment plants, axial flow pumps are often used to transfer large volumes of effluent between different stages of the treatment process.

        "details": "Label key components and flow direction, including the propeller, stator vanes, inlet, outlet, and pump shaft. Indicate the direction of rotation of the propeller and the flow path of the fluid."
    }

8.**Mathematical Derivations**Let's derive the relationship between the axial velocity of the fluid and the rotational speed of the propeller blades, based on the blade pitch angle. The blade pitch angle is the angle between the propeller blade and the plane of rotation.

    The flow rate ($Q$) through the pump can be expressed as the product of the cross-sectional area ($A$) and the axial velocity ($V_a$):

    $Q = A V_a$

    The axial velocity can also be related to the rotational speed ($\omega$) and the blade pitch angle ($\beta$) at a given radius ($r$). The tangent of the blade pitch angle is the ratio of the axial velocity to the tangential velocity:

    $tan(\beta) = \frac{V_a}{\omega r}$

    Therefore, the axial velocity can be expressed as:

    $V_a = \omega r tan(\beta)$

    Substituting this into the flow rate equation:

    $Q = A V_a = A \omega r tan(\beta)$

    Now, let's derive a simplified expression for the head developed by an axial flow pump, relating it to blade lift coefficient and fluid velocity. The lift coefficient is a dimensionless parameter that represents the lift generated by the blade relative to the dynamic pressure of the fluid.

    The lift force ($L$) generated by a propeller blade is similar to the lift force generated by an airfoil (airplane wing). The lift force can be expressed as:

    $L = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 C_L A_{blade}$

    Where:

    - $\rho$ is the fluid density.
    - $V$ is the relative velocity between the blade and the fluid.
    - $C_L$ is the blade lift coefficient.
    - $A_{blade}$ is the blade area.

    The head ($H$) developed by the pump is related to the pressure increase caused by the lift force:

    $H = \frac{\Delta P}{\rho g} = \frac{F/A}{\rho g}$

    Where:

    - F is the axial force produced by the pump.
    - A is the cross-sectional area of the pump.

    While an exact expression requires integrating the lift force distribution across the blade span, for simplification, we can say:

    $H \propto \frac{C_L V_a^2}{g}$ - The head is proportional to the Lift coefficient and the square of the axial velocity. This simplified relationship provides a useful approximation for understanding the factors that influence the head developed by an axial flow pump.

9.**Mirror ProblemsProblem 1 (Axial Velocity):** An axial flow pump has a propeller with a diameter of 420mm (radius of 0.21m) and a blade pitch angle of 26 degrees. If the propeller rotates at 1300 RPM, estimate the axial velocity of the fluid.

    *Solution:*

    1.  Calculate the angular velocity: $\omega = \frac{2\pi N}{60} = \frac{2\pi * 1300}{60} = 136.14 \text{ rad/s}$
    2.  Calculate the axial velocity: $V_a = \omega r tan(\beta) = 136.14 * 0.21 * tan(26) = 13.27 \text{ m/s}$

    **Problem 2 (Flow Rate Calculation):** Given the axial velocity calculated above (13.27 m/s) and the pump's cross-sectional area (0.1385 $m^2$), calculate the flow rate.

    *Solution:*

    1.  Calculate the flow rate: $Q = A V_a = 0.1385 * 13.27 = 1.84 \text{ m}^3\text{/s} = 110400 \text{ LPM}$

    **Problem 3 (Head Estimation):** Estimate the head developed by an axial flow pump given the axial velocity (3 m/s), blade lift coefficient (0.3), and fluid density (1000 kg/m^3).

    *Solution:*
    *This problem requires us to calculate head using the derived proportional relationship*
    $H \propto \frac{C_L V_a^2}{g}$ = $\frac{0.3 * 3^2}{9.81} = 0.275 \text{ m}$. This approximation does not take into account losses, and other design considerations.

    **Problem 4 (Pump Application):** A drainage system requires pumping 600 LPM at a head of 8 meters. Would an axial flow pump be suitable? Justify your answer.

    *Solution:*

    Axial flow pumps are best suited for applications with very high flow rates and low heads. While 600 LPM is a moderate flow rate, 8 meters is a relatively low head. An axial pump *might* be suitable, but likely wouldn't be the optimal choice. A mixed-flow pump may be a better selection in this scenario. The selection will also depend on the specific flow rate requirements of the application, as well as factors such as pump efficiency, cost, and maintenance requirements.
