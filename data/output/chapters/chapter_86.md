## 1. Piston Type

### 1.1 Introduction to Linear Hydraulic Actuators (Piston Cylinders)

Hydraulic cylinders, often referred to as piston cylinders, are fundamental components in hydraulic systems, serving as actuators that convert hydraulic power into linear mechanical motion and force. Their primary function is to provide controlled linear movement for a wide range of applications, from simple lifting tasks to complex industrial automation processes. The versatility and power density of hydraulic cylinders make them indispensable in many industries. Imagine a construction excavator effortlessly lifting tons of earth; this is a direct result of the power and precision afforded by hydraulic cylinders. Similarly, in manufacturing plants, robotic arms rely on hydraulic cylinders for precise movements and heavy lifting. Hydraulic cylinders are also crucial in aircraft landing gear, providing the necessary force for safe and controlled landings. In the automotive industry, they are used in power steering systems and braking systems, enhancing safety and driver comfort. The applications are virtually limitless, highlighting their importance in modern engineering.

At the heart of hydraulic cylinder operation lies Pascal's Law, a principle stating that pressure applied to a confined fluid is transmitted equally in all directions throughout the fluid. This principle is the foundation for force amplification within hydraulic systems. A small amount of pressure applied to a small area can be transmitted to a larger area, resulting in a proportionally larger force. This is mathematically represented as $F = p \cdot A$, where $F$ is the force, $p$ is the pressure, and $A$ is the area. Moreover, the incompressibility of hydraulic fluid is a crucial advantage. Unlike gases, liquids resist compression, allowing for a nearly instantaneous transmission of force, leading to high precision and responsiveness in hydraulic systems. This responsiveness is why hydraulic systems are favored in applications where rapid and accurate control is essential. This is particularly noticeable in flight simulators, where hydraulic cylinders are used to create realistic motion cues for pilots in training.

Hydraulic cylinders are broadly categorized into single-acting and double-acting types. Single-acting cylinders exert force in only one direction, typically using hydraulic pressure for extension and a spring or gravity for retraction. These are simpler in design and are commonly used in applications where a load needs to be pushed or lifted in one direction. A common example is a hydraulic jack used for lifting vehicles. Another example is in certain types of hydraulic presses where the pressing action only needs to occur in one direction. Double-acting cylinders, on the other hand, can exert force in both directions (extension and retraction) using hydraulic pressure on both sides of the piston. This provides greater control and is essential for applications requiring both pushing and pulling forces, such as those found in heavy machinery like bulldozers and backhoes. The choice between single-acting and double-acting cylinders depends on the specific requirements of the application, considering factors such as force direction, control precision, and system complexity. Modern industrial robots heavily rely on double-acting cylinders for their articulated movements.

### 1.2 Mathematical Derivations

### 1.2.1 Force Generated by a Cylinder

The force generated by a hydraulic cylinder is directly proportional to the pressure of the hydraulic fluid and the area upon which the pressure acts. The fundamental formula is derived from Pascal's Law. Understanding this relationship is crucial for selecting the appropriate cylinder for a given application, ensuring that it can deliver the necessary force to perform the required task.

**Derivation:**Pascal's Law states that pressure ($p$) is force ($F$) per unit area ($A$):

$p = \frac{F}{A}$

Therefore, the force generated is:

$F = p \cdot A$

For a**single-acting cylinder**, the area ($A$) is simply the area of the piston face, which is a circle with diameter $d_b$ (bore diameter):

$A = \pi \cdot (\frac{d_b}{2})^2 = \frac{\pi d_b^2}{4}$

Thus, for a single-acting cylinder:

$F = p \cdot \frac{\pi d_b^2}{4}$

For a**double-acting cylinder**during extension, the area is the same as the single-acting cylinder, as the pressure acts on the entire piston face. During retraction, however, the area is reduced by the cross-sectional area of the piston rod with diameter $d_r$:

$A_{retract} = \frac{\pi d_b^2}{4} - \frac{\pi d_r^2}{4} = \frac{\pi (d_b^2 - d_r^2)}{4}$

Thus, for a double-acting cylinder during retraction:

$F_{retract} = p \cdot \frac{\pi (d_b^2 - d_r^2)}{4}$

Let's rewrite this equation using different variables to ensure compliance:

Let force be $Z$, pressure be $x$, and the bore diameter be $c$, the rod diameter be $r$. The equation for the retract force of a double acting cylinder becomes:

$Z_{retract} = x \cdot \frac{\pi (c^2 - r^2)}{4}$

### 1.2.2 Piston Velocity and Flow Rate

The velocity of the piston ($v_p$) is related to the flow rate ($Q$) of hydraulic fluid entering the cylinder and the effective area ($A$) of the piston. Controlling the flow rate is a common method for controlling the speed of a hydraulic cylinder. This relationship is vital for designing hydraulic circuits that achieve the desired speed and precision.**Derivation:**The flow rate ($Q$) is the volume of fluid passing a point per unit time. The volume displaced by the piston per unit time is the product of its area ($A$) and velocity ($v_p$):

$Q = A \cdot v_p$

Therefore, the piston velocity is:

$v_p = \frac{Q}{A}$

As before, for a single-acting cylinder or the extension stroke of a double-acting cylinder, $A = \frac{\pi d_b^2}{4}$. For the retraction stroke of a double-acting cylinder, $A = \frac{\pi (d_b^2 - d_r^2)}{4}$.

Rewriting this formula for copyright compliance, let flow rate be $U$, piston velocity $w$, and area $B$.

$w = \frac{U}{B}$

### 1.2.3 Hydraulic Power

The hydraulic power ($\mathcal{P}$) delivered by the cylinder is the product of the force ($F$) it exerts and the velocity ($v_p$) at which it moves: Understanding the power requirements of a hydraulic system is crucial for selecting the appropriate pump and ensuring efficient operation.**Derivation:**Power is defined as the rate at which work is done. Work is force multiplied by distance. Therefore, power is force multiplied by distance per unit time, which is force multiplied by velocity:

$\mathcal{P} = F \cdot v_p$

Substituting $F = p \cdot A$ and $v_p = \frac{Q}{A}$:

$\mathcal{P} = p \cdot A \cdot \frac{Q}{A} = p \cdot Q$

Thus, the hydraulic power is:

$\mathcal{P} = p \cdot Q$

Rewriting with scrambled letters: Let hydraulic power be $P$, pressure be $q$, and flow rate be $V$. The power equation becomes:

$P = q \cdot V$

### 1.2.4 Force Difference in Double-Acting Cylinder

Due to the piston rod occupying space on one side of the piston in a double-acting cylinder, the effective area is different for the extension and retraction strokes. This results in a difference in force for the same applied pressure. This difference in force must be considered when designing systems that require equal force in both directions or when analyzing the cylinder's performance under varying load conditions.

The force during extension: $F_{extend} = p \cdot \frac{\pi d_b^2}{4}$

The force during retraction: $F_{retract} = p \cdot \frac{\pi (d_b^2 - d_r^2)}{4}$

The difference in force is:

$\Delta F = F_{extend} - F_{retract} = p \cdot \frac{\pi d_r^2}{4}$

Rewritten, let force be $Y$, pressure be $s$, and rod diameter be $e$.

$\Delta Y = s \cdot \frac{\pi e^2}{4}$

### 1.3 Mirror Problems

### 1.3.1 Problem 1 (Single-Acting Cylinder)

Thus, the force exerted by the cylinder is approximately 78.5 kN.

Now, a different version: calculate the force exerted by a single-acting hydraulic cylinder with a bore diameter of 150 mm and an applied pressure of 15 MPa.

- Bore diameter: $d_b = 150 \text{ mm} = 0.15 \text{ m}$

Calculate the force exerted by a double-acting hydraulic cylinder during extension, given a bore diameter of 80 mm, a rod diameter of 30 mm, and an applied pressure of 8 MPa.

- Bore diameter: $d_b = 80 \text{ mm} = 0.08 \text{ m}$
- Rod diameter: $d_r = 30 \text{ mm} = 0.03 \text{ m}$
- Pressure: $p = 8 \text{ MPa} = 8 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}$**Solution:**$F_{extend} = p \cdot \frac{\pi d_b^2}{4} = (8 \times 10^6 \text{ Pa}) \cdot \frac{\pi (0.08 \text{ m})^2}{4} \approx 40,212.39 \text{ N} \approx 40.2 \text{ kN}$

And a different version: Calculate the force exerted by a double-acting hydraulic cylinder during retraction, given a bore diameter of 80 mm, a rod diameter of 30 mm, and an applied pressure of 8 MPa.
