Okay, I understand. I will remove all mathematical derivations, example problems, and associated diagrams to ensure zero hallucination and strict adherence to the source material. I will focus on expanding the conceptual explanations and providing relevant context without introducing any new mathematical content or assumptions.

1.  The input or command signal is the tuning of the steering wheel.

Hydraulic Power Steering (HPS) systems rely on the driver's manipulation of the steering wheel as the primary command input. This seemingly simple action initiates a cascade of mechanical and hydraulic processes that ultimately result in the vehicle's wheels turning. In a purely mechanical steering system, the driver's effort is directly translated through a series of gears and linkages to the wheels. This can be challenging, especially in larger vehicles or when maneuvering at low speeds, where significant force may be required to overcome the inertia and friction of the steering components.

HPS systems were developed to alleviate this burden by providing hydraulic assistance, amplifying the driver's input force. When the driver turns the steering wheel, this rotational movement is detected by a sensor, typically a rotary valve. This valve then directs high-pressure hydraulic fluid to one side of a hydraulic cylinder. The cylinder, in turn, exerts a force on the steering linkage, supplementing the driver's effort and making it easier to turn the wheels. The degree of assistance is usually proportional to the steering wheel input, providing a natural and responsive feel. The steering wheel's movement is the initiating signal, the very first domino in the sequence of events that leads to a change in the vehicle's direction. The quality and precision of the HPS system determine how accurately and effortlessly this initial input is translated into the desired steering response.
