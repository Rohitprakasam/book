Typesofthermodynamic system

On the basis of mass and energy transfer the thermodynamic system is divided into 
threetypes.

1. Closedsystem

2. Opensystem

3. Isolated system

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg6_img1_b980ba.png]

Closedsystem:Asysteminwhichthetransferofenergybutnotmasscantakesplaceacross 
the 
boundary is called closed system. The mass inside the closed system remains constant.

For example: Boiling of water in a closed vessel. Since the water is boiled in closed vessel so

the mass of water cannot escapes out of the boundary of the system but heat energy

continuously entering and leaving the boundary of the vessel. It is an example of closed

system.

Open system: A system in which the transfer of both mass and energy takes place is called an

open system. This system is also known as control volume.

Forexample:Boilingofwaterinanopenvesselisanexampleofopensystembecausethe water and

heat energy both enters and leaves the boundary of the vessel.

Isolatedsystem: Asysteminwhichthetransferofmassandenergycannottakesplaceis called an

isolated system.

Example:

system boundary.

Pump - A continuous flowof fluidtakes place through the system with a transfer of mechanical

energy from the surroundings to the system.

MicroscopicViewor Study:

 The approach considers that the system is made up of a very large number ofdiscrete

particles known as molecules. These molecules have different velocities are energies.

The values of these energies are constantly changing with time. This approach to

thermodynamics, which is concerned directly with the structure of the matter, is

known as statistical thermodynamics.

 The behavior of the system is found by using statistical methods, as the number of

molecules is very large. So advanced statistical and mathematical methods are needed

to explain the changes in the system.

 The properties like velocity, momentum, impulse, kinetic energy and instruments

cannot easily measure force of impact etc. that describe the molecule.

 Large numbers of variables are needed to describe a system. So the approach is

complicated.

MacroscopicVieworStudy:

 In this approach a certain quantity of matter is considered without taking into account

the events occurring at molecular level. In other words this approach to

1


--- Page 8 ---

thermodynamics is concerned with gross or overall behavior. This is known as classical

thermodynamics.

 Theanalysisofmacroscopicsystemrequiressimplemathematicalformula.

 The value of the properties of the system are their average values. For examples

consider a sample of gasin a closed container. The pressure of the gas is the average

value of the pressure exerted by millions of individual molecules.

ThermodynamicEquilibrium:

A thermodynamic system is said to exist in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium when no

change in any macroscopic property is registered if the system is isolated from its

surroundings.

An isolated system always reaches in the course of time a state of thermodynamic equilibrium

and can never depart from it spontaneously.

Therefore, there can be no spontaneous change in any macroscopic property if the system

exists in an equilibrium state. A thermodynamic system will be in a state of thermodynamic

equilibrium if the system is the state of Mechanical equilibrium, Chemical equilibrium and

Thermal equilibrium.

 Mechanical equilibrium: The criteria for Mechanical equilibrium are the equality

ofpressures.

 Chemicalequilibrium:ThecriteriaforChemicalequilibriumaretheequalityofchemical

potentials.

 Thermalequilibrium:ThecriterionforThermalequilibriumistheequalityof temperatures.

State:

The thermodynamic state of a system is defined by specifying values of a set of measurable

properties sufficient to determine all other properties. For fluid systems, typical properties

are pressure, volume and temperature. More complex systems may require thespecification

of more unusual properties. As an example, the state of an electric battery requires the

specification of the amount of electric charge it contains.

Property:

 Propertiesmaybeextensiveor intensive.

 Intensive properties: The properties which are independent of the mass of thesystem.

For example: Temperature, pressure and density are the intensive properties.

 Extensiveproperties:Thepropertieswhichdependonthesizeorextentofthe system are

called extensive properties.

 Forexample:Totalmass,totalvolumeandtotalmomentum.

Process:

1


--- Page 10 ---

When the system undergoes change from one thermodynamic state to final state due change

in properties like temperature, pressure, volume etc, the system is said to have undergone

thermodynamic process.

Various types of thermodynamic processes are: isothermal process, adiabatic process,

isochoric process, isobaric process and reversible process.

Cycle:

Thermodynamic cycle refers to any closed system that undergoes various changes due to

temperature,pressure,andvolume,however,itsfinalandinitialstateareequal.Thiscycleis

important as it allows for the continuous process of a moving piston seen in heat engines and

the expansion/compression of the working fluid in refrigerators, for example. Without the

cyclical process, a car wouldn't be able to continuously move when fuel is added, or a

refrigerator would not be able to stay cold. Visually, any thermodynamiccycle will appear as

a closed loop on a pressure volume diagram.

Examples:Ottocycle,DieselCycle,BraytonCycleetc.

Reversibility:

Reversibility, in thermodynamics, a characteristic of certain processes (changes of a system

from an initial state to a final state spontaneously or as a result of interactions with other

systems) that can be reversed, and the system restored to its initial state, without leaving net

effects in any of the systems involved.

An example of a reversible process would be a single swing of a frictionless pendulum from

one of its extreme positions to the other. The swing of a real pendulum is irreversible because

a small amount of the mechanical energy of the pendulum would be expended in performing

work against frictional forces, and restoration of the pendulum to its exact starting position

would require the supplyof an equivalent amount of energy from a second system, such as a

compressed spring in which an irreversible change of state would occur.

Quasistaticprocess:

When a process is processing in such a way that system will be remained infinitesimallyclose

withequilibriumstate 
ateachtime,suchprocess 
will 
betermedasquasi 
staticprocess

orquasiequilibriumprocess.

In simple words, we can say that if system is going under a thermodynamic process through

succession ofthermodynamicstates andeach state isequilibrium statethentheprocess will be

termed as quasi static process.

1


--- Page 11 ---

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg11_img1_2cdcfc.png]

We will see one example for understanding the quasi static process, but let us consider one

simple example for better understanding of quasi static process. If a person is coming down

from roof to ground floor with the help of ladder steps then it could be considered as quasi

static process. But if he jumps from roof to ground floor then it will not be a quasi static

process.

Weight placed over the piston is just balancing the force which is exerted in upward direction

by 
gas. 
If 
we 
remove 
the 
weight 
from 
the 
piston, 
system 
will 
have

unbalancedforceandpistonwillmoveinupward

directionduetoforceactingoverthepistoninupward direction by the gas.

IrreversibleProcess:

Theirreversibleprocessisalsocalledthenaturalprocessbecausealltheprocessesoccurring 
in

nature are irreversible processes. The natural process occurs due to the finite gradient

between the two states of the system. For instance, heat flow between two bodies occurs

due to the temperature gradient between the two bodies; this is in fact the natural flow of

heat. Similarly, water flows from high level to low level,currentmoves from high potential

tolowpotential, etc.

 In the irreversible process the initial state of the system and surroundings cannot be

restored from the final state.

 Duringtheirreversibleprocessthevariousstatesofthesystemonthepathof change from

initial state to final state are not in equilibrium with eachother.

1


--- Page 12 ---

 During the irreversible process the entropy of the system increases decisively and it

cannot be reduced back to its initial value.

 Thephenomenonofasystemundergoingirreversibleprocessiscalledas irreversibility.

Causesof Irreversibility:

Friction: Friction is invariably present in real systems. It causes irreversibility in the processas

work done does not show an equivalent rise in the kinetic or potential energy of the system.

The fraction of energy wasted due to frictional effects leads to deviation from reversible

states.

Freeexpansion:Freeexpansionreferstotheexpansionofunresisted typesuchasexpansion in a

vacuum. During this unresisted expansion the work interaction is zero, and without the

expense of any work, it is not possible to restore initial states. Thus, free expansion is

irreversible.

Heat transfer through a finite temperature difference: Heat transfer occurs only when there

exists temperature difference between bodies undergoing heat transfer. During heat transfer,

if heat addition is carried out in a finite number of steps then after every step the new state

shall be a non-equilibrium state.

Non equilibrium during the process: Irreversibilities are introduced due to lack of

thermodynamic equilibrium during the process. Non-equilibrium may be due to mechanical

inequilibrium, chemical inequilibrium, thermal inequilibrium, electrical inequilibrium, etc.

and irreversibility is called mechanical irreversibility, chemical irreversibility, thermal

irreversibility, electrical irreversibility respectively. Factors discussed above are also causing

non-equilibrium during the process and therefore make process irreversible.

Heat:

It is the energy in transition between the system and the surroundings by virtue of the

difference in temperature Heat is energy transferred from one system to another solely by

reason of a temperature difference between the systems. Heat exists only as itcrosses the

boundaryofasystemandthedirectionofheattransferisfromhighertemperaturetolower

temperature. For thermodynamics sign convention, heat transferred to a system is positive;

Heat transferred from a system is negative.

Work:

If an object with a higher temperature comes in contact with an object of lower

temperature,itwilltransferheattothelowertemperatureobject.Theobjectswillapproach 
the

sametemperature and inthe absenceof lossto other objects,theywillmaintain asingle constant

temperature. Therefore, thermal equilibrium is attained.

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg17_img1_5b7a95.png]

If objects ‘A’ and ‘C’ are in thermal equilibrium with ‘B’, then object ‘A’ is in thermal

equilibrium with object ‘C’. Practically this means all three objects are at the same

temperature and it forms the basis for comparison of temperatures.

Ifa=b;b=cthena=c

PrinciplesofThermometry:

Thermometry is the science and practice of temperature measurement. Any measurable

changeinathermometricprobe(e.g.thedilatationofaliquidinacapillarytube,variationof

electrical resistance of a conductor, of refractive index of a transparent material, and so on)

can be used to mark temperature levels, that should later be calibrated against an

internationallyagreedunitifthemeasureistoberelatedtootherthermodynamicvariables.

Thermometry is sometimes split in metrological studies in two subfields: contact

thermometry and noncontact thermometry. As there can never be complete thermal

1


--- Page 18 ---

uniformity at large, thermometry is always associated to a heat transfer problem with some

space-time coordinates of measurement, given rise to time-series plots and temperature

maps.

Scalesof Temperature:

There are three temperature scales in use Fahrenheit, Celsius and Kelvin. Fahrenheit

temperature scale is a scale based on 32 for the freezing point of water and 212 for the boiling

point of water, the interval between the two being divided into 180 parts.

The conversion formula for a temperature that is expressed on the Celsius (C) scale to its

Fahrenheit (F) representation is: F = 9/5C + 32.

Celsius temperature scale also called centigrade temperature scale, is the scale based on 0 for

the freezing point of water and 100 for the boiling point of water.

Kelvin temperature scale is the base unit of thermodynamic temperature measurement in the

International System (SI) of measurement. It is defined as 1/ 273.16 of the triple point

(equilibrium among the solid, liquid, and gaseous phases) of pure water.

Joule’s experiment:

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg19_img2_8c1640.png]

James P. Joule carried out his famous experiment; he placed known amounts of water, oil, and

mercury in an insulated container and agitated the fluid with a rotating stirrer. The amounts

1


--- Page 20 ---

of work done on the fluid by the stirrer were accurately measured, and the temperature

changes of the fluid were carefully noted. He found for each fluid that a fixed amount of work

was required per unit mass for every degree of temperature rise caused by the stirring, and

that the original temperature of the fluid could be restored by the transfer of heat through

simple contact with a cooler object. In this experiment you can conclude there is a

relationship between heat and work or in other word heat is a form of energy.

InternalEnergy

Through, Joule experiment what happen to energy between time it is added to water as

work,andtimeitisextracted 
toheat?Logicsuggeststhatthisenergycontainedinthewater 
in

another form which called internal energy.

Internal energy refers to energy of molecules of substance which are ceaseless motion and

possess kinetics energy. The addition of heat to a substance increases this molecularactivity,

and thus causes an increase in its internal energy. Work done on the substance can have the

same effect, as was shown by Joule. Internal energy cannot be directly measured; there are

no internal-energy meters. As a result, absolute values are unknown. However,this is not a

disadvantage in thermodynamic analysis, because only changes in internal energy are

required.

FirstLaw of Thermodynamics:

During a thermodynamic cycle, a cyclic process the systems undergoes, the cyclic integral of

heat added is equal to integral of work done. The first law equation can also be written in the

form,

§(dQ– dW)=0

Equation dU = dQ – dW is a corollary to the first law of thermodynamics. It shows that there

exists a property internalenergy (U)of the system, suchthat achange inits valueis equalto the

difference in heat entering and work leaving the system.

The First law of thermodynamics states that energy is neither created nor destroyed. Thus the

total energy of the universe is a constant. However, energy can certainly be transferred from

one form to another form.

The1stlawofthermodynamicscanbemathematicallystatedasfollows:

§dQ =§dW

Corollary1:

There exists property of closed system; the change in value of this property during the process 
is given by the difference between heat supplied and work done.

1


--- Page 21 ---

dU =dQ-dW

Here E is property of system and is called as total energy that includes internal energy, kinetic

energy, potential energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, chemical energy, etc.

Corollary2:

Fortheisolatedsystem,heatandworkbothinteractionsareabsent(dQ=0,dW=0)and  
E  
=

constant. Energy can neither be created nor be destroyed; but, it can be converted from one

form to other.

Corollary3:

Aperpetualmotionmachineoffirstkindisalmost impossible.

PerpetualMotionMachineofFirstKind (PPM1):

A hypothetical machine which can produce useful work without any source or which can produce

more energy than consumed. It violates the first law of Thermodynamics. Perpetual Motion

Machine 1 (PMM1) is a machine that violates first law of thermodynamics. First law of

thermodynamics states that energy can be neither created or nor destroyed. A perpetual motion

machine 1 violates the law by creating energy. All processes in universe comply with first and second

law of thermodynamics. Therefore PPM1 does not and can never exist.

e.g.:Anelectricheaterthatconsumes1KWofelectricitycannotproducemorethan1KWheat.

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg21_img1_b57950.png]

Firstlawappliedtoaflowprocess Steadyflowenergyequation:

Virtually all the practical systems involve flow of mass across the boundary separating the

system and the surroundings. Whether it be a steam turbine or a gas turbine or a compressor

or an automobile engine there exists flow of gases/gas mixtures into and out of the system.

So we must know how the first Law of thermodynamics can be applied to an open system.

ThermalReservoir:

A thermal reservoir is a large system (very high mass x specific heat value) from which a 
quantity of energy can be absorbed or added as heat without changing its temperature. The 
atmosphere and sea are examples of thermal reservoirs. Any physical body whose thermal 
energy capacity is large relative to the amount of energy it supplies or absorbs can be 
modelledasathermalreservoir.Areservoirthatsuppliesenergyintheformofheat 
iscalled 
a 
source and one that absorbs energy in the form of heat is called asink.

HeatEngine:

It is a cyclically operating device which absorbs energy as heat from a high temperature 
reservoir, converts part of the energy into work and rejects the rest of the energy as heat to 
a thermal reservoir at low temperature.  
The working fluid is a substance, which absorbs energy as heat from a source, and rejects 
energy as heat to a sink.

turbinesthatgenerateelectricityareallexamplesofheatengines.

Heatpump:

A heat pump is a device that transfers heat energy from a source of heat to what is called a heat sink. 
Heat pumps move thermal energy in the opposite direction of spontaneous heat transfer, by 
absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A heat pump uses a small amount 
of external power to accomplish the work of transferring energy from the heat source to the heat 
sink. The most common design of a heat pump involves four main components – a condenser, an 
expansion valve, an evaporator and a compressor. The heat transfer medium circulated through 
these components is called refrigerant.

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg36_img1_9cf1dc.png]


--- Page 37 ---

SchematicrepresentationofHeatPumpCoefficientofPerformance

The coefficient of performance, COP, of a refrigerator is defined as the heat removed from the cold 
reservoir Qcold, (i.e. inside a refrigerator) divided by the work W done to remove the heat (i.e. the 
work done by the compressor).



COP-coefficientofperformance- equation

As can be seen, the better (more efficient) the refrigerator is when more heat Qcold can be removed 
from the inside of the refrigerator for a given amount of work. Since the first lawof thermodynamics 
must be valid also in this case (Qcold + W = Qhot), we can rewrite the above equation:

The COP for heating and cooling are thus different, because the heat reservoir of interest is 
different. When one is interested in how well a machine cools, the COP is the ratio of the heat 
removed from the cold reservoir to input work. However, for heating, the COP is the ratio of the 
heat removed from the cold reservoir plus the input work to the input work: medium to a high- 
temperature is called heat pump.

SecondLawofThermodynamics

The second law ofthermodynamics is a general principle whichplaces constraints uponthedirection of 
heat transfer and the attainable efficiencies of heat engines. In so doing, it goes beyond the limitations 
imposed by the first law of thermodynamics.

It is not possible for heat to flow from a colder body to a warmer body without any work having been 
done to accomplish this flow. Energy will not flow spontaneously from a low temperature object to a 
higher temperature object. This precludes a perfect refrigerator. The statements about refrigerators apply 
to air conditioners and heat pumps, which embody the same principles.

EquivalenceofKelvin-PlanckandClausiusStatements

To provethat violation of the Kelvin-PlanckStatement leadsto aviolationof the ClausiusStatement,let us 
assume that Kelvin-Planck statement is incorrect.


--- Page 39 ---

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg39_img1_41598d.png]

Consider a cyclically working device 1, which absorbs energy Q1 as heat from a thermal reservoir at TH. 
Equivalent amount of work W(W=Q1) is performed.

Consider another device 2 operating as a cycle, which absorbs energy QL as heat from a low temperature 
thermal reservoir at TL and rejects energy QH (QH=QL+W). Such a device does not violate Clausius 
statement.  
Ifthetwodevicesarenowcombined,thecombined device(enclosedbythedottedboundary)transfers heat QL 
from the low temperature reservoir at TL to a high temperature reservoir at TH without receiving any aid 
from an external agent, which is the violation of the Clausius statement.

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg39_img2_6d70ee.png]

Likewise let us assume that the Clausius statement is incorrect. So we have a device 1, cyclicallyworking 
transferring heat Q from a low temperature reservoir at TL to a high temperature thermal reservoir at TH 
.

If the two devices are combined (shown in figure by a dotted enclosure), then the combined device 
receives energy (Q1-Q) as heat from a thermal reservoir and delivers equivalent work (W=Q1-Q) in 
violation of the Kelvin-Planck statement.  
Therefore violation of Clausius statement leads to the violation of the Kelvin-Planck statement. Hence, 
these two statements are equivalent.

Principleofincreaseofentropy

Let a system change from state 1 to state 2 by a reversible process A and return to state 1 by another 
reversible process B. Then 1A2B1 is a reversible cycle. Therefore, the Clausius inequality gives:


--- Page 57 ---

Ifthesystemisrestoredtotheinitialstatefrom1tostate2byanirreversibleprocessC,then1A2C1is 
an

irreversible cycle. Then the Clausius inequality gives:

Subtractingtheaboveequationfromthefirstone,

Sincetheprocess2B1isreversible,



Where the equality sign holds good for a reversible process and the inequality sign holds 
good for an irreversible process.  
Now letus apply theaboveresult to evaluatetheentropy changeof theuniversewhena

Thereforetheentropyofanisolatedsystemeitherincreasesor,inthelimit,remains constant.  
The equality sign holds good when the process undergone by the system is reversible, the 
inequality sign holds good if there is any irreversibility present in the process. This 
statement is usually called the principle of entropy increase.

Irreversible or spontaneous processes can occur only in thatdirection for which the entropy 
of the universe or that of an isolated system, increases. These processes cannot occur in 
the direction of decreasing entropy.  
Foranisolatedsystem,

Thermodynamicpotentials

Thermodynamic potentials are state functions that, together with the corresponding equations ofstate,

describe the equilibrium behavior of a system as a function of so-called ”natural variables”. The natural

variables are a set of appropriate variables that allow to compute other state functions by partial

differentiation of the thermodynamic potentials.

UNIT-III  
Propertiesofpuresubstances:

Pure substance

A substance that has a fixed chemical composition throughout the system is called a pure 
substance. Water, hydrogen, nitrogen, and carbon monoxide, for example, are all pure 
substance. A pure substance can also be a mixture of various chemical elements or 
compounds as long as the mixture is homogeneous. Air, a mixture of several compounds, is 
often considered to be a pure substance because it has a uniform chemical composition. “A 
mixture of two or more phases of a pure substance is still a pure substance as long as the 
chemical composition of all phases is the same. A mixture of ice and liquid water, for example, 
is a pure substance because both phases have the same chemical composition.”

PVTSurface


--- Page 75 ---

Pressure can be expressed as a function of temperature and specific volume:p = p(T, v). The plot ofp = 
p(T, v) is a surface called p-v-T surface. Figure 3.1 shows the p-v-T surface of a substance such as water 
that expands on freezing.

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg75_img1_a8f1a9.png]

Figure3.1p-v-Tsurfaceandprojectionsforasubstancethatexpandsonfreezing.

(a)3-Dview(b)p-Tdiagram(c)p-vdiagram2.

The location of a point on the p-v-T surface gives the values of pressure, specific volume,and 
temperature at equilibrium. The regions on the p-v-T surface labeled solid, liquid, and vapor 
are single-phase regions. The state of a single phase is determined by any two of the 
properties: pressure, temperature, and specific volume. The two-phase regions where two 
phases exist in equilibrium separate the single-phase regions. The two-phase regions are: 
liquid-vapor, solid-liquid, and solid-vapor. Temperature and pressure are dependent within the 
two-phase regions. Once the temperature is specified, the pressure is determined and vice 
versa. The states within the two-phase regions can be fixed by specific volume and either 
temperature or pressure.

The projection of the p-v-T surface ontothe p-Tplane is known as the phase diagram as 
shown in Figure 3.1 (b). The two-phase regions of the p-v-T surface reduce to lines in the phase 
diagram. A point on any of these lines can represent any two-phase mixture at that particular 
temperature and pressure. The triple line of the p-v-T surface projects onto apoint on the 
phase diagram called the triple point. Three phases coexist on the triple line or the triple point.

The constant temperature lines of the p-v diagram are called the isotherms. For any 
specified temperature less than the critical temperature, the pressure remains constant

withinthe two- phaseregion eventhoughspecific volume changes. In thesingle-phaseliquid and 
vapor regions the pressure decreases at fixed temperature as specific volume increases. For 
temperature greaterthan orequal to the critical temperature,there isnopassage across the 
two-phase liquid-vapor region.

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg76_img1_579c30.png]

Figure3.1-2 T-vdiagramforwater (to scale).

Figure 3.1-2 is a T-v diagram for water. For pressure greater than or equal to the critical 
pressure, temperature increases continously at fixed pressure as the specific volume increases 
and there is no passage across the two-phase liquid-vapor region. The isobaric curve marked 
50 MPa in Figure 3.1-2 shows this behavior. For pressure less than the critical value, there is a 
two-phase region where the temperature remains constant at a fixed pressure as the two- 
phase region is traversed. The isobaric curve with values of 20 MPa or less in Figure 3.1-2 shows 
the constant temperature during the phase change.

At 100oC, the saturated volumes of liquid and vapor water are 1.0434 cm3/g and 
1,673.6 cm3/g, respectively. The quality of steam is the mass fraction of water vapor in a 
mixture of liquid and vapor water. The specific volume of 100oC steam with a quality of 0.65 is 
given by

v = (1-0.65)vL+0.65vV= (0.35)(1.0434)+(0.65)(1,673.6)= 1088.2 cm3/g PhaseBehavior:

We will consider a phase change of 1 kg of liquid water contained within a piston-
cycinder assembly as shown in Figure 3.2-1a. The water is at 20oC and 1.014 bar (or 1 
atm) as indicated by point (1) on Figure 3.2-2.

As the water is heated at constant pressure, the temperature increases 
withaslightincreaseinspecificvolumeuntilthesystemreachespoint(f).Thisisthe saturated liquid state 
corresponding to 1.014 bar. The saturation temperature for water at 1.014 bar is 100oC. The liquid 
states along the line segment 1-f are called subcooled or compressed liquid states. When the system 
is at the saturated liquid state (point f in Figure 3.2-2)anyadditional heat willcause the liquid to 
evaporateat constant pressure as shown in Figure 3.2-1b. When a mixture of liquid and vapor exists 
in equilibrium, the liquid phase is a saturated liquid and the vapor phase is a saturated vapor.

Liquidwatercontinuestoevaporatewithadditionalheatuntilitbecomesall 
saturated vapor at point (g). Any further heating will cause an increase in both 
temperature and specific volume and the saturated vapor becomes superheated 
vapor denoted by point (s) in Figure 3.2-2. For a two-phase liquid-vapor mixture, the 
quality x is defined as the mass fraction of vapor in the mixture

mvapor x =  
mvapor+mliquid

Whena substanceexistsas part liquid andpart vapor at saturation conditions,itsquality (x) is defined 
as the ratio of the mass of the vapor to the total mass of both vapor and liquid.

Enthalpy–EntropyChart


--- Page 78 ---

An enthalpy–entropy chart, also known as the H–S chart or Mollier diagram, plots the total 
heat against entropy, describing the enthalpy of a thermodynamic system. A typical chart 
covers a pressure range of 0.01–1000 bar, and temperatures up to 800 degrees Celsius. It 
shows enthalpy H in terms of internal energy U, pressure p and volume V using the 
relationship H=U+pV or, in terms of specific enthalpy, specific entropy and specific volume.

On the diagram, lines of constant pressure, constant temperature and volume are plotted, so 
in a two-phase region, the lines of constant pressure and temperature coincide. Thus, 
coordinates on the diagram represent entropy and heat.

A vertical line in the h–s chart represents an isentropic process. The process 3–4 in aRankine 
cycle is isentropic when the steam turbine is said to be an ideal one. So the expansion process 
in aturbine can be easilycalculatedusingthe h–s chart whentheprocess is considered to be 
ideal (which is the case normally when calculating enthalpies, entropies, etc. Later the 
deviations from the ideal values and they can be calculated considering the isentropic 
efficiency of the steam turbine used.

Lines of constant dryness fraction (x), sometimes called the quality, are drawn in the wet 
region and lines of constant temperature are drawn in the superheated region. X gives the 
fraction (by mass) of gaseous substance in the wet region, the remainder being colloidal liquid 
droplets. Above the heavy line, the temperature is above the boiling point, and thedry 
(superheated) substance is gas only.

Separating Calorimeter


--- Page 82 ---

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg82_img1_b955d3.png]

The wet steam enters at the top from the main steam pipe through holes in the sampling pipe 
facing up stream which should be as far as possible downstream from elbows and valves to 
ensure representative sample of steam when in operation the wet steam entering passes 
down the central passage and undergoes a sudden reversal of direction of motion when 
strikes perforated cup.

The weight of steam passing through the jacket may also be readily determined by passing the escaping 
steam into a bucket of water where it is condensed, the increase in the weight of the bucket and 
itscontentsgivingthe value of W.In that case gauge Gisnot required,but it used itsreadingmay be taken 
as a check.

ThrottlingCalorimeter


--- Page 83 ---

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg83_img1_645151.png]

In the throttling calorimeter, a sample of wet steam of mass m and at pressure P1 is taken from 
the steam main through a perforated sampling tube. Then it is throttled by the partially-
opened valve (or orifice) to a pressure P2 measured  
by  
mercurymanometer, and 
temperature t2, so that after throttling the steam is in the superheated region.

The steady flow energy equation gives the enthalpy after throttling as equal to enthalpy before 
throttling. The initial and final equilibrium states 1 and 2 are joined by a dotted line since 
throttling is irreversible (adiabatic but not isentropic) and the intermediate states are non-
equilibrium states not describable by thermodynamic coordinates. The initial state(wet) is 
given by P1and x1 and the final state by P2 and t2.

Advantages:

CombinedSeparatingandThrottlingcalorimeter


--- Page 84 ---

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg84_img1_06a059.png]

When the steam is very wet and the pressure after throttling is not low enough to take the 
steam to the superheated region, then a combined separating and throttling calorimeter is 
used for the measurement of quality.

Steam from the main is first passed through a separator where some part of the moisture 
separates out due to the sudden change in direction and falls by gravity, and the partiallydry 
vapour is then throttled and taken to the superheated region.


--- Page 85 ---

In Fig. process 1-2 represents the moisture separation from the wet sample of steam at 
constantpressureP1 and process2-3represents throttling to pressure P2. With P2 and t3 being

relation between pressure, volume, and temperature called the general gas law.

Gas Laws:

Boyle’sLaw

Boyle’s Law Pressure is inversely proportional to volume: p∞ 1/v Robert Boyle noticed that 
when the volume of a container holding an amount of gas is increased, pressure decreases, 
and vice versa (while the temperature is held constant). Note that this is not a linear 
relationship between p and V.

Charles’Law:

Charles’ Law Volume is directly proportional to temperature: V = cT, where c > 0 is constant. 
Scientist Jacque Charlesnoticed that if air in aballoon isheated,the balloon expands.For an 
ideal gas, this relationship between V and T should be linear (as longas pressure isconstant).

Individual Gas Constant - R

The Individual Gas Constant depends on the particular gas and is related to the molecular 
weight of the gas. The value is independent of temperature. The induvidual gas constant, R, 
for a gas can be calculated from the universal gas constant, Ru (given in several unitsbelow), 
and the gas molecular weight, Mgas:

R=Ru/Mgas

Inthe SIsystemunitsareJ/kgK.

TheUniversalGasConstant -Ru

The Universal Gas Constant - Ru - appears in the ideal gas law and can be expressed as the 
product between the Individual Gas Constant - R - for the particular gas - and the Molecular 
Weight - Mgas - for the gas, and is the same for all ideal or perfect gases:

Ru = Mgas R, kJ/(kmol.K) : 8.3144598

TheMolecularweightofaGas Mixture

The average molecular weight of a gas mixture is equal to the sum of the mole fractions of

Throttling Process:

The porous plug experiment was designed to measure temperature changes when a fluid 
flows steadily through a porous plug which is inserted in a thermally insulated, horizontal pipe. 
The apparatus used by Joule and Thomson is shown in Figure


--- Page 90 ---

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg90_img1_e0e63b.png]

A gas at pressure and temperature flows continuously through a porous plug in a tube 
and emerges into a space which is maintained at a constant pressure. The device isthermally 
insulated and kept horizontal. Consider the dotted portion as controlvolume.

Theseresultsin

Therefore, whenever a fluid expands from a region of high pressure to a region of low pressure 
through a porous plug, partially opened valve or some obstruction, without 
exchanginganyenergyasheat and workwith thesurrounding(neglecting,the changesin PE and 
KE), the enthalpy of the fluid remains constant, and the fluid is said to have undergonea 
throttling process.  
Free expansion (or unresisted expansion) process. A free expansion occurs when a fluid is 
allowed to expand suddenly into a vaccum chamber through an orifice of large dimensions. 
In thisprocess,no heat is supplied or rejected and noexternal work is done. Hencethetotal heat 
of the fluid remains constant. This type of expansion may also be called as constant total heat 
expansion. It is thus obvious, that in a free expansion process,

Q1-2 =0, W1-2=0 anddU=0.

vanderWaalsEquationof State:

The ideal gas law treats the molecules of a gas as point particles with perfectly elastic 
collisions. This works well for dilute gases in many experimental circumstances. But gas 
molecules are not point masses, and there are circumstances where the properties of the 
molecules have an experimentally measurable effect. A modification of the ideal gas lawwas 
proposed by Johannes D. van der Waals in 1873 to take into account molecular size and 
molecular interaction forces. It is usually referred to as the van der Waals equation ofstate.


--- Page 91 ---

The constants a and b have positive values and are characteristic of the individual gas. The 
van der Waals equation of state approaches the ideal gas law PV=nRT as the values of these 
constants approach zero. The constant a provides a correction for the intermolecular forces. 
Constant b is a correction for finite molecular size and its value is the volume of one mole of 
the atoms or molecules.

Since the constant b is an indication of molecular volume, it could be used to estimate the 
radius of an atom or molecule, modeled as a sphere. Fishbane et al. give the value of b for 
nitrogen gas as 39.4 x 10-6 m3/mol.

Mixturesofperfect Gases:

A mixture, consisting of several pure substances, is referred to as a solution. Examples of pure 
substances are water, ethyl alcohol, nitrogen, ammonia, sodium chloride, and iron. Examples 
of mixtures are air, consisting of nitrogen, oxygen and a number of other gases, aqueous 
ammonia solutions, aqueous solutions of ethyl alcohol, various metal alloys. The pure 
substances making up a mixture are called components or constituents.

MoleFraction:

The composition of a gas mixture can be described by the mole fractions of the gases present. 
The mole fraction ( X ) of any component of a mixture is the ratio of the number of moles of 
that component to the total number of moles of all the species present in the mixture ( ntot ):

xA=molesofA/totalmoles

=na/ntot

=nA/(nA+nB+ )

To see how mole fractions can help us understand the properties of gas mixtures, let’s 
evaluate the ratio of the pressure of a gas A to the total pressure of a gas mixture that contains 
A . We can use the ideal gas law to describe the pressures of both gas A and the mixture: 
PA=nART/V and Ptot=ntRT/V . The ratio of the two is thus

PA/Ptot=nA/ntot=xA

AtmosphericAir:

Atmospheric air makes up the environment in almost every type of air conditioning system. 
Hence a thorough understanding of the properties of atmospheric air and the ability to 
analyze various processes involving air is fundamental to air conditioning design.


--- Page 103 ---

Psychrometryisthestudyofthepropertiesofmixturesofairandwatervapour.

Atmospheric air is a mixture of many gases plus water vapour and a number of pollutants The 
amount of water vapour and pollutants vary from place to place. The concentration of water 
vapour and pollutants decrease with altitude, and above an altitude of about 10 km, 
atmospheric air consists of only dry air. The pollutants have to be filtered out before 
processing the air. Hence, what we process is essentially a mixture of various gases that 
constitute air and water vapour. This mixture is known as moist air.

PsychrometricProperties:

Dry bulb temperature (DBT) is the temperature of the moist air as measured by a standard 
thermometer or other temperature measuring instruments.

Saturated vapourpressure (psat) isthe saturatedpartialpressure of water vapour atthedry bulb 
temperature. This is readily available in thermodynamic tables and charts.  
ASHRAE suggests the following regression equation for saturated vapour pressure of water, which 
is valid for 0 to 100oC.

Relativehumidity(Φ)isdefined asthe ratioof the mole fractionof water vapour in moist air to 
mole fraction of water vapour in saturated air at the same temperature and pressure. Using

usually referred to as air standard cycle.

OttoCycle

The Air Standard Otto cycle is named after its inventor Nikolaus A. Otto . Figures 5.1 (a), (b) 
and (c) illustrate the working principles of an Otto cycle. The Otto cycle consists of the 
following processes.

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg115_img1_397272.png]

--- Page 116 ---

0-1: Constant pressure suction during which a mixture of fuel vapour and air is drawn into the 
cylinder as the piston executes an outward stroke.

1-2:Themixtureiscompressedisentropicallyduetotheinwardmotionofthepiston. Because of the 
isentropic compression , the temperature of the gas increases.  
2-3: The hot fuel vapour-air mixture is ignited by means of an electric spark. Since the 
combustion is instantaneous, there is not enough time for the piston o move outward. This 
process is approximated as a constant volume energy addition process .

3-4: The hot combustion products undergo isentropic expansion and thepiston executesan outward 
motion.

4-1: The exhaust port opens and the combustion products are exhausted into the atmosphere. 
The process is conveniently approximated as a constant-volume energy rejection process.

1-0:Theremainingcombustionproductsareexhaustedbyaninwardmotionof 
thepistonat 
constant 
pressure.

Effectively there are four strokes in the cycle. These are suction, compression, expression, and 
exhaust strokes, respectively. From the P-V diagram it can be observed that the work done 
during the process 0-1 is exactly balanced by the work done during 1-0. Hence for the purpose 
of thermodynamic analysis we need to consider only the cycle 1-2-3-4, which is air- standard 
Otto Cycle.

(5.14) Compression ratio

Since , the efficiency of the Otto cycle increases with increasing compression ratio.However, 
in an actual engine, the compression ratio can not be increased indefinitely since 
highercompressionratiosgivehighervaluesofandthisleads to spontaneous and uncontrolled 
combustion of the gasoline-air mixture in the cylinder. Such a condition is usually called 
knocking.

[ORIGINAL_ASSET:extracted_images/pg118_img1_040271.png]

Figure5.2

Performance of an engine is evaluated in terms of the efficiency (see Figure 5.2). However, 
sometime it is convenient to describe the performance in terms of mean effective pressure, 
an imaginary pressure obtained by equating the cycle work to the work evaluated by the 
following the relation

0-1: Constantpressure suctionduringwhich fresh air isdrawn into the cylinderas thepiston executes 
the outward motion.

1-2: The air is compressed isentropically. Usually the compression ratio in the Diesel cycle is 
much higher them that of Otto cycle. Because of the high compression ratio, the temperature 
of the gas at the end of isentropic compression is so high that when fuel is injected, it gets 
ignited immediately.


--- Page 120 ---

2-3: The fuel is injected into the hot compressed air at state 2 and the fuel undergoes a 
chemical reaction. The combustion of Diesel oil in air is not as spontaneous as the combustion 
of gasoline and the combustion is relatively slow. Hence the piston starts moving outward as 
combustion take place. The combustion processes is conveniently approximated as a constant 
pressure energy addition process.

3-4: The combustion products undergo isentropic expansion and the piston executes an outward 
motion.  
4-1: The combustion products are exhausted at constant volume when the discharge port opens. 
This is replaced by a constant-volume energy rejection process.

1-0: The remaining combustion products are exhausted at constant pressure by the inward motion 
of the piston.

and part of the energy is added at constant pressure. The remaining processes are similar to 
those of the Otto cycle and the Diesel cycle. The efficiency of the cycle can be estimated in

The components of a Brayton cycle device for jet propulsion are shown in Figure 3.14. We will 
typically represent these components schematically, as in Figure 3.15. In practice, real Brayton 
cycles take one of two forms. Figure 3.16(a) shows an ``open'' cycle, where the working fluid

the alternative, a closed cycle, which re circulates the working fluid. Closed cycles are used, for
